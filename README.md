# Mind Under Matter

My mum makes the joke that my Dad's mental age can be found by adding up the
numbers in his physical age. This site offers an interface for exploring what
this means.

For example, I am 23, so my dad would have to be 599 before he is at my level.
*Assuming my Dad's condition is not hereditary and my mental age is the same as
my physical age - **doubtful***
